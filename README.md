# Introduction
Hello, there!

I developed a game called A Jornada de Sofia (Sofia's Journey).
It is a short and educational game project for Universidade de Fortaleza (Unifor), it covers Mathmatics and Portuguese subjects, more dedicated to children between the ages of 8 and 12.

# Sinopse
Sofia is a brave and intelligent girl who likes adventure. One day, at home, Sofia received a letter from her grandmother, saying that she missed her granddaughter, she called Sofia to visit her and eat cake. Of course Sofia wants to visit her grandmother and eat cake, but she didn't expect the challenges that would arise...

# Scenes
**Casa (Home)**
- Sofia is in home and the game starts a cutscene. In this cutscene, Sofia goes to the front door to see a letter sent by her grandmother. 

**Fora de Casa (Outside Home)**
- Sofia is out of her home. The scenary has some houses, a path and a sign. She have to pass through the sign, when she does this, a dialogue starts (guiding players on what they should do). So, when the dialogue ends, she has to follow the path until the end, but in the end, a mystery creature appears on her back, then another dialogue begins. The mystery creature is Guia Mágica (Magic Guide), a fairy-like creature that will help Sofia until the end of her journey.

**O Caminho da Matemágica (The Path of Mathmagics)**
- Now Sofia is in The Path of Mathmagics, a dense forest full of forks. A dialogue begins between Sofia and Guia Mágica (Magic Guide), the guide explains about this path and its challenges. Sofia has to walk along the path until she sees the first fork, a random generated Math question, with 4 options to respond. If she responds it right, The Path will show her the correct way, else, it will show her the wrong way (when she reaches the end of it, a black screen will appear saying that you missed the question and you should try again). When Sofia is walking through the right way, she will face another challenge, this one being a little bit harder, it is a random generated multiplication question with sum (with the sum appearing first to deceive those who do not perform multiplication first). Again, if she gets it right, the correct way will be revealed, else, the incorrect way is going to be. When she gets it right again, she will face the last challenge, a random generated division question. So, when she passes the last one, she will reach the other scene.

**A Floresta das Palavras (The Words Forest)**
- Sofia is now in The Words Forest, a dense forest that looks like fall. Again, a dialogue begins, but this one is just the guide congratulating Sofia.

I'm still writing, please stand by :P
