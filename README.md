# Introduction
Hello, there!

I developed a game called A Jornada de Sofia (Sofia's Journey).
It is a short and educational game project for Universidade de Fortaleza (Unifor), it covers Mathmatics and Portuguese subjects, more dedicated to children betwwen the ages of 8 and 12.

# Sinopse
Sofia is a brave and intelligent girl who likes adventure. One day, at home, Sofia received a letter from her grandmother, saying that she missed her granddaughter, she called Sofia to visit her and eat cake. Of course Sofia wants to visit her grandmother and eat cake, but she didn't expect the challenges that would arise...

# Scenes
**Home**
- Sofia is in home and the game starts a cutscene. In this cutscene, Sofia goes to the front door to see a letter sent by her grandmother. 

**Outside Home**
- Sofia is out of her home. The scenary has some houses, a path and a sign. She have to pass through the sign, when she does this, a dialogue starts (guiding players on what they should do). So, when the dialogue ends, she has to follow the path until the end, but in the end, a mystery creature appears on her back, then another dialogue begins. The mystery creature is Guia MÃ¡gica (Magic Guide), a fairy-like creature that will help Sofia until the end of her journey.
